# Open Neuroimaging Datasets

* Acronyms:
    * Imaging Modalities:
        * MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)
            * if imaging modality is MRI with no prefix (such as f, for fMRI), this refers to structrual MRI (sMRI)
        * fMRI - functional MRI
        * dMRI - diffusion MRI
        * DTI - Diffusion Tensor Imaging, a type of diffusion MRI
        * PET - Positron Emission Tomography
        * CT - X-ray Computed Tomography
        * MEG - Magnetoencephalography
        * MRA - Magnetic Resonance Angiogram 
    * Imaging Sequences:
        * T1/T1w - [T1-weighted imaging](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/t1-weighted-image)
        * T2/T2w - [T2-weighted imaging](http://radiopaedia.org/articles/t2-weighted-image)
        * PD - proton density
        * FLAIR - Fluid-attenuated inversion recovery, a T2-weighted modality
    * Diseases
        * TBI - Traumatic Brain Injury
        * AD - Alzheimer's Disease (most likely) or Autism Disorder (usually in child data sets)
        * MCI - Mild Cognitive Impairment
        * ADHD - Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder
        *
